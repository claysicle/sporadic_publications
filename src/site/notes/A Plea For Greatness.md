How weak is he
Who mourns
The pains of life,
Or wishes them lesser?

The pains of life
Are what rise a man
And bring him Greatness –
These triumphs are Man’s Might.

These pains 
Are your glory,
So do not let sophists
Lead you astray.

There are those who speak
Of happiness and ease.
Ask yourself now;
Whom does this please?
 
The I Above,
Of Wisdom and Soul?
Or
The I Below,
Of meat and bone?

What are you?
How do you define yourself?
Is it by blissful adolescence,
Or by maturity and resolve?

The world will give you 
That which you desire.
It will provide the fuel –
You must light the fire.

I implore you 
and myself,
and all men now –
Desire Greatness.

Light the fires of Transcendence,
And ignite a flame of Intent. 
Fight the dimming of your Intellect,
And refuse to play pretend.

Do not let yourself degrade,
In Mind
In Body,
In Soul.

Become what hedonists hate,
Become
The Tale
Of Old.

Become pristine,
Cut from marble!
A Man of ideals,
Become a marvel!

A Warrior,
A Mage,
A Ruler,
A Sage!

A Roman,
A Greek,
A Viking,
A Freak!

Become what you are,
and fret not over pleasures.
Follow your heart,
And spare it no measures.

I ask again,
Do not ignore this!
I implore you my friend –
Desire Greatness.

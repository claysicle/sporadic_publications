in every crinkle
and
in every wrinkle.

in every face,
and
in every place.

in every digit,
and
in every fidget.

see God in it all;
better than 
youâ€™ve been
in years.

see God in it all;
see again -
your friend
is tears.

by God,
be grateful
and faithful.
the world is
oh, so beautiful.

by God,
be colorful
and musical.
your cup is
oh, so Godfull.

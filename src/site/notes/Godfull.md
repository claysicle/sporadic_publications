in every crinkle
and
in every wrinkle.

in every face,
and
in every place.

in every digit,
and
every fidget.

see better
than you have in years
see so much
you fall to tears.

see God in it all;
better than 
youâ€™ve seen
in years.

see God in it all;
now let it
leave you
drenched
in tears.

by God,
be grateful
and
be faithful.
the world is
oh, so beautiful.

by God,
be colorful
and
be musical.
your cup is
oh, so Godfull.

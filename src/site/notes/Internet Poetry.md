I went
on a poetry website
and was at first
greeted by
a woman
talking about
her salty vagina.

The next, 
an autist
who had used 
AI
to narrate
erotic slop.

I do not hate
women.
I do not hate
AI.
I do not hate
autists.

I do hate
how I feel.

I feel
unseen.
I feel
unwelcome.
I feel
cold.
I feel
sick.

I feel tired.

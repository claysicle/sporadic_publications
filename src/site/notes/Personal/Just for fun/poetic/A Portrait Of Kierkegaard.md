# Refusing The Wandering Soul

Finding The King a man most horrid,
I ventured ‘cross Plains of Deceit,
Forged through the Rivers of Nihil,
And conquered the Mountains Drear.

I arrived upon a lone tower
Rising above the landscape
In a pine-laden forest
occluded by perpetual fog.

Drawn in by a lantern’s golden light
Hanging by a porch-column,
I knocked hardily upon
that heavy oaken slab.

Reverberations echoed hollow
Upward throughout the chamber’s heights,
And after patience a moment extended,
The sound of footsteps descended from on high.

The door creaked wearily
And a man peeked out a single timid eye.
“Did The King send you?”
He asked with a wavering voice.

“I come seeking refuge from his cruelty,”
I replied staunchly, without resolution.
“So you are like myself,” The fearful man said,
And slammed his door shut.

I waited there for weeks,
Through bone-chilling rains,
and face-scorching days,
But no answer came.

So I ventured out into that wood
Coming upon naught else
And have left in the world
only this record of my loss.

THE END

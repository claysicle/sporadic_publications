In every crinkle
and
In every wrinkle.

In every place,
and
In every face.

In every digit,
and
In every fidget.

See God in it all;
better than 
you’ve been
in years.

See God in it all;
see again
your friend
is tears.

By God,
be grateful
and faithful!
The world is
oh, so beautiful.

By God,
be colorful
and musical!
Your cup is
oh, so Godfull.

Don't offend serenity.
Don't break a thoughtful moment,
with thoughtless 
anxious sound.

Don't you see what I've found?
They all over there
cheering and jeering wearily,
don't they see the silence? 
isn't it serene?

Or am I 
the only one who sees it,
floating 
on the breeze?

I've nothing against a cheer,
but don't do it 
out of fear
of the silence.

It isn't all that scary,
once you've sat with it.
Trust the silence,
and it will embrace you
without a word.

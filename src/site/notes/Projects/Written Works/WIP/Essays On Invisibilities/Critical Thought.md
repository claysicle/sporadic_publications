I would like to begin this exploration not with a statement of any position of mine, but rather with an image. I have immediately failed this task as a consequence of an incessant and pernicious need for self-explanation as seen in this preemptive paragraph, but will proceed with my image regardless which I outline and may be colored-in by the reader as follows:

Imagine if you will, a squirrel. A grey squirrel is mine, but you may choose another if you prefer. Once you have him there – his glimmering and beady black eyes, his hunched over back, his large bushy tail, and the rest of what you might imagine a squirrel entails – once you have that sorted, I would like you to now imagine him in a sage-green knitted wool sweater, and to give him a pair of silver wire framed spectacles, and to put him into a pair of trousers. Not pants, *crucially*… but trousers. (As a note the sweater doesn’t absolutely have to be sage-green, but its style must offer some analog to that same tone that would otherwise have been induced. Colors such as maroon are fine, but colors such as hot pink, baby blue, or the family of neons and the like are *not* permissible, as no squirrel would be caught dead in such offensively colored garb).

Now put before him an old newspaper flipped to the back with that week’s game of sudoku showing itself. Next, place a fine felt-tipped pen with his initials on it next to the paper and now the scene is complete, save for perhaps a hot beverage and a comfy chair that he could fall back into if he were so inclined – or rather, reclined. What would you imagine that our bespectacled fellow would do in this scenario? 

It is an open scene, but I for one imagine him becoming enraptured with that puzzle set before him almost instantly and not putting it down until he has completed the entire thing, indulging with every stroke of that pen that he had obviously hand-picked with the utmost of concern for his morning-time sudoku escapades. I cannot even imagine that he would act another way, as it is so obvious to me by way of his demeanor that this squirrel cannot be any other thing but a sudoku connoisseur.  

I would like you to now remove all of the adornments that our friend here has been afforded and return him to that initial, primal, *animal* state. Now again, set him there before that paper and see how he proceeds. I suspect that similarly to myself, you imagine that he would now have a fairly different reaction to the game of sudoku. Perhaps he tears it. Chews it with his teeth, makes a nest of it. He may even ignore it entirely. We cannot say entirely, but what we know for sure is that he is now no gentleman toward his prior task.

This has not been a directionless demonstration. What I have set out to make seen in this is the present humanness of critical thought, paired with the comfort that is required for such an activity to take place. Provided that the proper precautions – sweaters and trousers, beverages and comfy chairs, harmonious color choices and felt-tipped pens – are present, critical thought is facilitated, but absent these comforts it is next to impossible to truly achieve. 

Think then what you require to bring about this state of critical mindedness. You may not need quite the same things as our reified rodent, but I would suspect you have a ritual of your own that allows you such a mental space. For me music, showers, and an organized desk are helpful, as well as a severed internet connection. I would urge you to experiment and find what works for yourself.

> *In [[Projects/Written Works/WIP/Essays On Invisibilities/Invisibilities Of People\|Invisibilities Of People]]*

I have grown up to be a somewhat solitary creature, but on occasion I peek out from my comfortable solitude and find myself amazed at how much I take the people in my life for granted. Presently I would like to voice an appreciation toward those who I seem to take for granted most frequently, here being my family. 
I will make an effort to write in a somewhat generic sense as this is a public work rather than a private letter, but each essay will be unavoidably colored the fact that it will be an expression of personal experiences. I will be sticking to a traditional understanding of familial roles in these essays, if only because it would become quite stale to continuously rewrite the truism that ‘there are of course many different ways in which people are (insert familial role)-s’.

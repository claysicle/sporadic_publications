Serenity. Solace. A quiet breeze that blows along a maple leaf through the river of air surrounding. The softness of a summer gently sliding its warm light against your cheek. Is this peace? I can’t think of much else that would be closer.

To my mind, peacefulness appears to be prerequisite for all security or like senses, and those who are lucky enough to possess it are like lighthouses amongst a sea of darker and dreadfully delirious dispositions. To be stressed and stretched changes your ability to operate at a cogent level. To have even composed a single sentence requires not just literacy, but a deeper sense that there is not some impending doom lurking just outside your vision, that sense being one that is often only able to be enforced by external means. Peacefulness then, is a light to write by. It is that which makes all higher functions of humanity possible to achieve, and assists in any person’s aspirations toward a lighter and more enlightened mind.

Some people believe that true peace is something that is only achieved within, but I counter this by saying that even if you could achieve some ideal state of inner peace by means of pure internal workings, I don’t think it would be a very good idea. I counter also by noting that even the Buddha had to get away from it all and go sit underneath his tree to find his inner peace, and from what I’ve heard he was at least somewhat informed upon the topic of peacefulness. 

There are some situations wherein a peaceful disposition ought to be suspended, and I think the gurus and pseudo-spiritualists are often not very cognizant of that fact. To be fair, if you are off in some monastery where every second of your day is perfectly regulated – then yes, a peaceful mind is an acceptable state. But what of the rest of us out here in the *real* world? Those of us who have not put an entire mountain between ourselves and the nearest non-robed human soul?

This is of course quite rich of me to say seen that I have put myself in a state of relative isolation over the last year (and that I indeed have worn a bathrobe for quite a large portion of it) but it is my hope that once I come down from my mountaintop, I will have maintained some portion of that peace that I have found there. It is my hope that this will have been a period dedicated to the cultivation of peace, rather than a mere indulgence in it. But, enough about me.

A peaceful mind is a valuable asset, indeed it is one of the most valuable assets that a person can have. As true as this is, it is important to also remember that the best use of most assets is not simple possession but investment – to let an asset sit unused is to waste your own potential. This is something that any competent financial advisor will tell you that you ought to do if you want to maximize your  monetary returns, and so I suspect that things are no different when it comes to the topic of peace.

I of course do not mean to say that you ought never enjoy a moment of peace and keep it for yourself - I would be a most horrible hypocrite to suggest as such - but I do think that peace is one of the nourishments that keeps the mind fresh, and that fresh things ought not to be squandered and hoarded until they spoil, but should be continually refreshed. Peacefulness then is not an idle reservoir upon which you call whenever you are thirsting, but it is a bubbling brook that can be dipped into at any time. It is notable that this flowing outward of peace must not be stopped… or else it may dry up and leave you in drought.

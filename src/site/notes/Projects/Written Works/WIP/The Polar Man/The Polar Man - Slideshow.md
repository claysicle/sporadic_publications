# The Polar Man

[[Projects/Written Works/WIP/The Polar Man/The Polar Man\|The Polar Man]]


---

A windswept landscape of blinding white snow expands unto distant dunes that if not for their pale coloration would suggest that one was in the Mojave Desert. Up behind these powdered hills lies a small igloo. The entrance is simple, requiring that one would crawl to come across the threshold to the insulated inner world.

---

For those who are curious, the igloo itself was not so much the cartoonish type that you might imagine an Inuit from the Northern Greenland area to reside within, but was more so a ramshackle of ice and haphazardly packed snow. There was something approximating an attempt at a chimney for venting heat at the top, but the intended hole really came to be more aptly described most simply as a structural fault. The innards of the place were cramped, but despite all flaws they did manage to achieve their ostensible goal of moderate insulation.

---

That inner place was sparse, with that which was there scattered about the small space. There was a pot holding melting snow over top of a hot plate connected to a large solar-charged battery pack. Chunks of seal meat sat in that melting snow, first being preserved by the cold and soon to be in the process of being cooked. There are no seasonings in the pot save for some salvaged tree bark, likely sourced from quite a distance given the lack of life in the nearby landscape.

---

There was also a man in this place. The man was cocooned inside of his sleeping bag, stuffed with most of the clothing that he owned while wearing the rest. To give an account: he wears two hats, a plain navy beanie with a rabbit fur-lined Ushanka hat over top; two pairs of gloves, rubber work gloves as the first and again with rabbit fur lining the outer layer; two shirts; the pattern repeats, two coats, one could extrapolate their style from previous statements; and two pairs of pants – for this the outer layer is a pair of commercially available L.L. Bean snow-pants.

---

Some time along, the man awakens with a stiff groan. His eyes slit open ever so slightly so as to keep them from the sting of the cold. He can smell the seal meat, as it has now become a mild stew. He takes a deep breath in through his nose, filling his lungs with fresh oxygenation tinged with the smell of his developing broth. 

---


He holds for but a moment and smiles at the filling of his lungs, and while still holding contemplates his meal that is in preparation with great eagerness. He then releases his breath with equal satisfaction, abiding to wait until the time for his meal has come. Patience is a virtue made unquestionable to this man, treated with the same respect as the ubiquity of scientific theory, or even a God. 

---

He outstretches a gloved hand and grasps toward what he left by his side before falling to his brief slumber – a well-kept paperback whose face read: 

---

>**<u>The Complete Recovered Journals Of Admiral Byrd</u>**
>
>Compiled by The New Hyperboreans Common Project

---


He takes off his gloves, placing them into his sleeping bag with him to preserve their warmth. He grazes his fingers over the book’s cracked spine, then thumbs open to a dog-eared page which read:

---

>**0949 Hours** – 29 minutes elapsed flight time from the first sighting of the mountains, it is no illusion. They are mountains and consisting of a small range that I have never seen before!​

---

He stews in the quotation, then reads another:

---

> **1000 Hours** – We are crossing over the small mountain range and still proceeding northward as best as can be ascertained. Beyond the mountain range is what appears to be a valley with a small river or stream running through the center portion. There should be no green valley below. Something is definitely wrong and abnormal here!

---

And once more:

---


> **1005 Hours** – I alter altitude to 1400 feet and execute a sharp left turn to better examine the valley below. It is green with either moss or a type of tight knit grass. The Light here seems different. I cannot see the Sun anymore. We make another left turn and we spot what seems to be a large animal of some kind below us. It appears to be an elephant! NO!!! It looks more like a mammoth! This is incredible! Yet, there it is! Decrease altitude to 1000 feet and take binoculars to better examine the animal. It is confirmed – it is definitely a mammoth-like animal! Report this to base camp.

---

He is just as struck by it now as he first was when he came across it on the forums of the NHCP (New Hyperboreans Common Project) not more than six months ago. It electrifies him in every penned word, as if Admiral Byrd himself is there in that frigid igloo, narrating right along to him for every step of it. His own highlights and margin notations serve as an imaginary dialogue with the Admiral for whom he had such admirations. The pages bore notations such as:

---

> What did you mean by this?

Or,

 > What other wonders did you see?

And,

>Why would you hide the full truth? What scared you so?

---

These notations are commonplace and written with a conversational tone, almost as if he expects an answer from Byrd himself beyond the grave. 

In fact, to his mind he soon would.

He owned a small shortwave radio system which was powered by the same means as his hotplate. Every night as soon as it became too dark to read he would tune in. He would twist the dial this way and that, straining his ears to hear through the static. He would strain and strain then strain some more, until finally he began to hear.

---

It would begin simply. Low and slight mumbles that he could barely hear. That was when he knew he was getting close. He would keep tuning, and would begin to make out words. A syllable here of ‘moun- … - pan - … - cal’ and another there of ‘tund - … - wal - … - een’.

Shortly after he would tune in enough to make out words, and soon enough he would be picking up the whole of Byrd’s nightly message. Once he was sure that he had heard the whole of a given message, he would begin to transmit one back.

---

Byrd’s messages were highly utilitarian in nature. Byrd referred to the adventuring man as ‘Rescue Scout’ or for short, sometimes simply ‘Scout’. He would make note of various features of the landscape, and tell his scout of the oasis. He would share details regarding various advancements in knowledge that he had made there up in his encampment, research projects and the like. The first few exchanges they had once our scout got in range went something like this:

“Copy out, this is a member of the NHCP making my third broadcast. Is there anyone out there?”
Silence, then –  
“You’ve made contact, scouter. NHCP you say?”
“Oh, uh, yes sir. New Hyperboreans Common Project. A, uhm… science expedition.”
“Hyperboreans?”
“Northern peoples in short, yes sir.”
“Hmph.”
“Do you know the name?”
“…”
And that was all.

---


The next day:
“Copy out, this is a member of the NHCP making my fourth broadcast. Is there anyone out there? …The sir from yesterday, perhaps?”
As before, a moment passed.
“I copy, scouter.”
“Glad to hear another voice. And could I ask your coordinates?”
A laugh crackled through the line.
“I don’t think you’d believe me if I told you that one.”
“A name then?”
Another chuckle, followed snidely by “Call me… Santa Claus!”
“Very funny, contact. And so then I’d assume your location would be…”
“THE NORTH POLE! Oh, you are a good one, aren’t you?”
The scouter chuckled a bit, then pressed in the radio switch and said “That’s what my momma says, sir.”
“I bet she does, scouter. I do bet she does.”
“Sir, may I ask a question?”
“Ask away, you funny kid.”
“Have you heard of an Admiral Byrd on any radio channel out here?”
The line was silent for a bit.
“Tell ya what scouter, you play any chess?”
“Yes sir, I was on the team in High School.”
“And you know chess notation?”
“Yes sir I do.”
“Alright then… e4.”
“Well sir… e5. I assume we’re…playing for info here?”
“You’re clever too! Your momma must be a proud one, scouter!”
“I’d hope so, sir.”
“If you win kiddo, I’ll let you in on as much as you’d like about the whereabouts of your Admiral Byrd.”

---

And of course that night he went on to win, at which point the Admiral spilled the beans and amazed the scouter with stories of a lush oasis filled with mammoths and creatures far, far more fantastical than that. Undiscovered dinosaurs, fruits that were nourishing beyond belief, trees that walked and monkeys that talked! – provided they were given a proper education in the English language, of course. 


---

He would send his nightly report to Byrd as if he were his rescuer, and would refer to himself as ‘Rescue Scout’. His transmissions would report things such as his current supplies, approximate coordinates, updates to his estimated time of arrival, and also briefings on any anomalous activity – of which there was quite little.

He would also report various jokes and riddles to Byrd that he thought of throughout the day. In addition to this, him and Byrd exchanged a single piece of chess notation in each transmission, and over the last month had developed along into the throes of a fierce chess battle.

---

But, returning back to our Scout in his sleeping bag, this day had not made it quite so far along just yet. The sun was still in the sky, and so it was not yet time for the nightly transmission. For now he put his copy of Byrd’s diary back down, then shimmied his way out of his sleeping bag in order that he could retrieve his quickly developing stew. 
Once retrieved, he ate the stew quickly and without restraint, as he ate all of his meals. Once thereafter satisfied he returned to his sleeping bag, but not before leaving his battery pack outside to charge in the solar rays for the upcoming radio exchange. He began to drift off to sleep, vague impressions of the Oasis so soon to come taking shape in his mind.

---

Before he could settle in, our scout awoke to the sound of a transmission. It was crackly at first, words morphing and garbled. He opened his eyes wide, and was immediately alert.

This was unusual.

He tore off his gloves and took quick hold of the tuning knob, trying to calm his shaking finger that he might tune into the message. He took a deep breath and managed it. He then heard the transmission as follows:

‘Rescue Scout, this is your Admiral reporting a distress signal. I repeat, this is Admiral Byrd reporting in distress! The encampment has been compromised, Bogies have been spotted and are approaching the encampment. I urge Rescue to turn back now. I repeat, turn back now! Do not come. Do **not** come to me scout. All I can ask of you now is that you pray for me. Godspeed.’ There was then a ‘chunk’-ing sound signaling end of transmission.

Hands once more shaking, he took hold of his transmitter and gave his response:

‘Admiral, This is Rescue! How have you been compromised?! I am only a day out from the encampment, a half-day if I rush. Do you have intel on the bogie? I repeat, do you have intel? Over.’

There was no answer, though he waited minutes. He periodically transmitted quickly so as to not block the signal, saying:

‘Admiral, do you copy?’
‘Admiral, are you present?’
‘Admiral Byrd, what is your status?’

Then he noticed that his radio had died. He scrambled to grab his battery pack from outside the igloo, and in the process of doing so kicked a substantial amount of snow into his sleeping bag. He hooked up the pack to his radio system, which lit back up immediately.

‘Admiral, do you copy?’
Nothing.
He tensely contemplated the situation, then gave a message:

‘I’m coming for you, Admiral. Your research will not be in vain.’

Still nothing.

‘Admiral, I’m now turning off my radio so as to preserve solar power. Our next contact will be in the encampment. From there, we can exchange info on the bogies and develop a plan. Over and out.’

He hung up his radio set immediately, not giving even a moment for an answer. There wasn’t time to waste. He had his mission, and he had his plan: move. Now all that was left was execution.

Go to sled.
Load gear:
Solar pack,
radio,
sleeping bag with clothes, 
hot plate,
and the stew,
stowed quickly but carefully into a thermos.

Sled is loaded.
Push sled.
Slip foot, find traction, push again.
Grip wood, gloves tight. 
Gain speed. 
Begin to run.
and run,
and run, 
and now a sprint,
and now a jump,
and now we’re sledding.

Sled hits a hill.
jump off, 
push
and push,
and struggle like Sisyphus,
and struggle some more.
Halfway up,
feet slip.
*Don’t fall*.

Catch, and keep on.
Keep the pressure,
keep the tension.
This is it,
that’s it now.
Now we’re there,
at the top of the hill. 

With a moment of grand release, take that final step to push the sled over the edge of that hill, close the eyes for just a second, freedom, liberation, wind through the hair…

Hit the bottom. Open eyes. Sled is sliding along the tundra like a watercraft through solemn waters. Keep it going with a push here or there, until there is another hill.

And then it repeats.
And repeats.
And repeats once more.

… And now it is hours later, and time to check coordinates.
And the coordinates… match the Admirals.

What? How?

He checks again, and again they match. 

Where is the oasis? The research base, Hyperborea! Where is it? It must be here, mustn’t it? Where was the Admiral?

“Admiral!” The scouter shouts.
“ADMIRAL!” He shouts louder, to no response.


And then there is a crackle from his radio.

“Copy out, this is Artic Scout. I'm on an expedition headed north. Does anyone read? Over.”

He picked up his radio, pressed the toggle and began to speak.

“Copy.”

“What is your location?”

A moment’s pause, and the scouter looks around him at the empty landscape devoid of life, a pure white expanse unto bleakness.

He returns to the other scouter:
“Have you ever heard of Hyperborea?”

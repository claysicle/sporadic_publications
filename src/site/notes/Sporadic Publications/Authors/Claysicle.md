## About

As of writing this, I am 21. I spend a decent chunk of my time at home, and have been writing regularly since high school. I am inspired most potently by a grab-bag of writers such as [[Emerson\|Emerson]], [[Twain\|Twain]], [[CS Lewis\|CS Lewis]], [[Phillip K Dick\|Phillip K Dick]] and [[Ray Bradbury\|Ray Bradbury]]. A large spread of stylistic influences are blended together in a (hopefully) harmonious manner throughout my work.
 If you’re reading this you probably know me, and you probably think I’ve finally lost it. Because I’m writing it - you’re probably right.

## Fun Facts

- My username is a portmanteau of ‘Clayton’ and ‘Sickler’, which is my real name.
- I probably overuse alliteration, but I like it too much to stop.
- I like the videogame Factorio. I’ll be going on 600 in-game hours very soon, and I regret none of them.
- If you bring this project up to me in real life I will either be happy to talk about it or I will be tempted to commit a large variety of crimes against you. Results may vary.

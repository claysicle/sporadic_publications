# About

I am [[Sporadic Publications/Authors/Claysicle\|Claysicle]]. If you’re reading this you probably know me, and you probably think I’ve finally lost it (or you would prefer if I just wrote a blog like a normal person).

# My Inspirations

Inspired most potently by a grab-bag of writers such as [[Emerson\|Emerson]], [[Twain\|Twain]], [[CS Lewis\|CS Lewis]], and [[Ray Bradbury\|Ray Bradbury]], a large spread of stylistic influences are blended together in a (hopefully) harmonious manner throughout my work. I will write about pretty much anything I want – it is my own publication, after all.

# Fun Facts

- My username is a portmanteau of ‘Clayton’ and ‘Sickler’, which is my real name.
- I probably overuse alliteration, but just like it way too much – the same is true with the em-dash.
- I like the videogame Factorio – a lot. I’ll be going on 600 in-game hours very soon, and I regret none of them.
- If you bring this project up to me in real life I will either be happy to talk about it or I will be tempted to commit a large variety of crimes against you. Results may vary.

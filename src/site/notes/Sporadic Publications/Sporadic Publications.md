## Welcome to Sporadic Publications!

I am [[Sporadic Publications/Authors/Claysicle\|Claysicle]]. 

[[Sporadic Publications/This Website\|This Website]] is a library of my written work. 

If you’d like, take something off the shelf (no library card needed).

# The Library


### [[Sporadic Publications/Works/Essays/Essays On Invisibilities/Essays on Invisibilities\|Essays on Invisibilities]]
A collection of roughly 40 essays that are directed toward giving attention to simple things that are often overlooked. It contains series of vivid observations regarding our world, our experiences, our minds, and ourselves.
I wrote these over the course of 2025 and am fairly proud of what I’ve written. Once finished this will be my first piece of writing that I will make available for others to read.

### <u>Daylight By A Thousand Stars</u>
An Existentialist Fantasy novel that I started in high school. 
Will I ever actually publish it? 
…Maybe.

### <u>The Aspirations of Apollo Carver</u>
Another novel, thematically Moralistic. The story centers on a man who aspires to be the best that he can be despite facing a series of deeply harrowing life events. 
This is nowhere near being finished but its something I look forward to writing, so it might motivate me to finish some other things in order to be able to work on it.

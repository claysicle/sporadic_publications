## Welcome to Sporadic Publications!

I am [[Sporadic Publications/Authors/Claysicle\|Claysicle]]. 

[[Sporadic Publications/This Website\|This Website]] is a library of my written work. 
If you’d like, take something off the shelf (no library card needed).
# [[Sporadic Publications/Works/Essays/Essays On Invisibilities/Essays on Invisibilities\|Essays on Invisibilities]]
A series of roughly 40 essays that are directed toward giving attention to simple things that are often overlooked. 
I wrote these over the course of 2025 and am fairly proud of what I’ve written. Once finished, this will be my first piece of writing that I will make available for others to read.

# <u>Daylight By A Thousand Stars</u>
An existentialist fantasy novel that I started in high school. 
Will I ever actually publish it? Maybe.

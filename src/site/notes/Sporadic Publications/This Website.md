What you are looking at right now is a representation of a [GitHub] repository that I submit my pages and edits to when they are finished.
I don’t really understand everything that is going on underneath the hood here, but I also really don’t need to. That is because I am using a piece of text editing software called [Obsidian] in combination with a plugin for the software called [Digital Gardens]. These two resources along with [GitHub] and something called [Vercel] allow me to publish and host this site – completely free of charge. I would highly recommend all of these tools to anyone who wants to publish writing online.
There are various other ways to publish written material online, but nothing else that I have found is quite as versatile as this combination of tools, and for that I am incredibly grateful to have them.

An action is quite the ephemeral thing. It is performed, and then the moment after it is gone. One may say that the list of skills that I presented prior is not so different from a list of actions, but to those people I would point out a present fact: I have labeled them differently. Seeing this, I cannot imagine that anyone would continue on to think that they are in any way the same. With that, the objection is dismissed.
There are many actions that are quite impactful, but are often not seen as being very grand and so tend to blend into the background of life. Doing the dishes, or laundry, cleaning off a desk, or just organizing a bookshelf are things that donâ€™t quite garner the utmost appreciation, but I think they ought to. And so as we are now growing used to (hopefully fondly so), I will give my thoughts.

To regard a concept as a thing elsewhere from man is a somewhat Platonist notion, and is therefore quite passé, but I am doing it here just the same. Those philosophically savvy enough to know what Platonism is should also be aware that Third Wave Platonism is a rising philosophical mode on our horizon anyway, so I would hope you’ll allow me to consider these things as I please without bothering me too horribly.  To all others: Sorry about that, and I’ll do my best to keep any further word vomit either to myself or otherwise directed squarely into the toilet.
For these next few essays I would like to forewarn: My essays within will be nowhere near comprehensive of the subjects explored. I am merely writing that which comes to mind most vividly and nothing more. I apologize if any of the following seems incomplete, as it almost certainly is. 
This said, read on.

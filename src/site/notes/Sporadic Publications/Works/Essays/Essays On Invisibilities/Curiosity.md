To regard curiosity as a virtue may be not quite controversial, but it is certainly an odd move on its face, so I would like to clarify what I do and do not mean.

Raw intellect is not what I am referring to, although intellect can be occasionally conflated with intellectual curiosity in certain minds and is occasionally thought more important. But no, what I am instead referencing is the presence of an aspiration toward intellect, or if such a word continues to irritate it could be expressed in parallel as an aspiration toward understanding. I would maintain that the aspiration toward understanding is valuable in and of itself, and even if something approximating a powerful intellect was never achieved, a person would be better for having been curious, and that the spark of curiosity must not always lead to a blaze in order to be bright in itself. 
What I wish to appreciate here really is that glint in a child’s eye that can be seen when you tell then why the sky is blue, or explain to them what a rainbow really is. The raw intellectual power of said child may yet be undeveloped, but the rightly curious child will nonetheless explore the domain of the idea whether they are able to master it or not.
Curious children are of course quite common, but what is all too rare is the curious adult. In defense of the adult, there are a multitude of reasons they may suppress or otherwise extinguish that exploratory flame that they harbored in their youth. To assist in a pivot elsewhere as I have not much left to say there, here is a quotation from a fellow essayist to spur on our closing thoughts:

*“The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.”*
	– **Plutarch**

This gets at the heart of why I have chosen curiosity as our Virtue of mind as opposed to something like intellect. Anyone can keep a bonfire going, or keep a cup of water upright upon a table. Once you’re smart, you’ve more or less got it. It takes an effort to start the fire in the first place, or to go off and fetch a pail of water yourself. That is where Virtue lies as far as I can see. It is not in the possession of knowledge, but in the desire for it. It is not in our knowing that we gain, but in our wanting to know.

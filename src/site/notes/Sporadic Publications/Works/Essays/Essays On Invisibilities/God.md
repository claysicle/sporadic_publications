Pretext:
- I must confess something prior to this essay, and it is this - I have been setting myself up for this one for the entire book. Indeed, I most likely would not have written a word of this if not in an attempt to build toward what follows. Bearing that in mind, if you have skipped straight here right upon getting the book, I would recommend at least skimming a few others beforehand, as the general disposition required for what follows is largely informed by our explorations until this point. 


That being said, please enjoy.

Many will object to the inclusion of God within the conceptual category, but I would like to quickly remind those individuals that I have also put such things as the Universe and the Atom herewithin, so I am by no means postulating His exclusion from realness. 
This being said, I find that understanding that God exists at least partially as a concept is a necessary component of understanding Him. I will not speak here on the objective existence of God, but I will state that as a God-believing man myself, I cannot rightly pretend that my *understanding* of Him is objective, although many do in fact find the task undifficult.
But no – I do not have an objective understanding of God, nor can I even offer an adequate description. All I really have are my experiences, which are fully and completely subjective. There is Scripture of course, and there are the Early Church Fathers, and there are the creeds and the theologians who wrote them – but when I count all of it up it amounts to nothing more than syntactic constructions. There is no love in it inherent to itself, no peace, no wisdom, and there is indeed no power in it. Those things only come into play once I have really experienced God. Only then do these things shine with the luster of the Divine. Without that, everything else is just ink on pulp.
The only reason that I believe comes down to a subjective feeling, a knowing that is personal only to myself. For theists and atheists alike, I would like to make that clear.
One thing said by many a Preacher, Priest, or Pope is that God is found best by the Bible. I do not object that God is rightly found there, but contest the exclusivity which is often imparted upon this so said-to-be most sacred scripture. I think it is the case that God’s presence in scripture is not categorically distinct from his presence in the rest of his creation. It is my case that I find God in all his mountains, lakes, rivers, and songs, and in every Invisibility through and through. 
And so God is the ultimate Invisibility – Indeed, He is the light by which all visible or otherwise invisible things become known and seen. 
As far as religious labeling goes, I refer to myself by the following string of insults: I state most accurately that I am an Agnostic Theist with a Christian lens. Woof. What I mean by that is this:
That there is a way of looking at things as purely physical things, as atoms bouncing around made of protons and electrons and neutrons, which are made of quarks, which are made of fundamental particles, which are made of whatever other gunk is underneath that.
And if all you are interested in is effecting outcomes outside of yourself in that physical world, then that’s all there really is – the framing is sufficient as a workable explanation. But if you have greater aspirations than just accuracy, you are a far shot off from having figured everything out yet.
At this point the analysis of the outer world is no longer sufficient. You must turn inward. When I do so and when I am able to abdicate entirely, I find at my center something that I consider to be a centerless origination. I find that underneath all of thoughts, feelings, memories, and other gunk, there is a sort of eternal being that transcends me, you, or anything that could ever exist in the external world.
I call that God, and I understand it primarily through the lens of the Christian religion. Were I raised different I may have come to regard it differently, or I may have come to be a Christian just the same. One way or the other, I cannot really say. 
I cannot prove it exists in any sense external to myself, but I believe in it nonetheless, simply because I find that it is far too important and essential of a spiritual reality to ignore, and so whether or not it exists as any sort of physical cognate is more or less irrelevant to me.

God is my everything. He is there when I wake, and there when I go to sleep. I also make an effort to clue Him in on as much as I can regarding all that lies between.

He is there when I am strong,
He is there when I am weak.
He is there when I feel Him,
He is there when I hate Him.

Sometimes I really wish he would just leave me forever, but however much I might plead He seems to stick around. He can be needy like that sometimes, I suppose.

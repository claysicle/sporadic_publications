## This Collection's Aspirations

What follows is a collection of essays which I have focused on some subjects that struck me as  deserving of greater consideration than they are often given. My aim in writing each of these essays has been to direct an appropriate appreciation toward these topics in hopes that they are brought to the forefront of the mind of the reader, as well as myself.

With regard to the readers:
I cannot guarantee that any of this will be relevant to many others aside from myself, as I have very intentionally kept the essays highly subjective. These are not traditional ‘informative’ essays as most people are regularly familiar with, but have been written with a more expressive intention. The aim of the project at base is to talk of what I see when I make an effort to notice certain things so obvious or otherwise routine that they blend into the background of life, so it may be the case that the essays themselves do the same. However in the full consideration of things, I think it will be a nourishment to those who are seeking after the same things as myself to read these essays, and so I would urge you to lend me your valuable reading time in at least a passive sense. You ought not burden yourself with much more than a passing curiosity about the following text, and I aspire that it be the manner of exploration that directs the spirit of my writing as well. 

With regard to myself: 
To write an essay on anything requires thoughtful consideration of said thing. This necessarily means that over the course of writing these essays, I will be reflecting upon things that I consider worthy of appreciation. In practice I wish to hold lightly to that appreciation – but hold to it nonetheless. As an activity, the writing of these essays will be an attempt at an expansion of my personal awareness regarding the space which each ‘Invisibility’ is situated within. In exploring this space it is my hope that the intangibility of each subject will fade, and thus will grow to become potent factors of my life at the forefront of my mind. I hope that as a result this exercise, I will afterward be able to notice the subjects explored in a more vivid sense after coming away from them, as well as apply that practiced state of thoughtfulness toward various other focal points that may enter my field of consideration.

Put more simply: I hope that you enjoy what follows, I hope to enjoy writing it, and I hope that we can each come away from this collection having made our minds and our worlds a brighter and more vivid reality as a result.

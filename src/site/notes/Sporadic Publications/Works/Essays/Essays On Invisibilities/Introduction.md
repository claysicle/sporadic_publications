## This Collection's Aspirations

What follows is a collection of essays which I have focused on some subjects that struck me as  deserving of greater consideration than they are often given. My aim in writing each of these essays has been to direct an appropriate appreciation toward these topics in hopes that they are brought to the forefront of the mind of the reader, as well as myself.

With regard to the readers:
I cannot guarantee that any of this will be relevant to many others aside from myself, as I have very intentionally kept the essays highly subjective. These are not traditional ‘informative’ essays as most people are regularly familiar with, but have been written with a more expressive intention. The aim of the project at base is to talk of what I see when I make an effort to notice certain things so obvious or otherwise routine that they blend into the background of life, so it may be the case that the essays themselves do the same. However in the full consideration of things, I think it will be a nourishment to those who are seeking after the same things as myself to read these essays, and so I would urge you to lend me your valuable reading time in at least a passive sense. You ought not burden yourself with much more than a passing curiosity about the following text, and I aspire that it be the manner of exploration that directs the spirit of my writing as well. 

With regard to myself: 
To write an essay on anything requires thoughtful consideration of said thing. This necessarily means that over the course of writing these essays, I will be reflecting upon things that I consider worthy of appreciation. In practice I wish to hold lightly to that appreciation – but hold to it nonetheless. As an activity, the writing of these essays will be an attempt at an expansion of my personal awareness regarding the space which each ‘Invisibility’ is situated within. In exploring this space it is my hope that the intangibility of each subject will fade, and thus will grow to become potent factors of my life at the forefront of my mind. I hope that as a result of this exercise, I will afterward be able to notice the subjects explored in a more vivid sense after coming away from them, as well as apply that practiced state of thoughtfulness toward various other focal points that may enter my field of consideration.

Put more simply: I hope that you enjoy what follows, I hope to enjoy writing it, and I hope that we can each come away from this collection having made our minds and our worlds a brighter and more vivid reality as a result.

## What is an Invisibility?

To answer the question quite quickly:
A thing seen but not thought of, or a thing thought of that is rarely (if ever) seen.

To answer the musing more measuredly:
An Invisibility is not something that is strictly speaking ‘not visible’, although it sometimes really is. What I am speaking of when I use the word Invisibility is that element of perception that can only be accessed when you are really and truly ‘paying attention’. 
‘Paying attention to what?’ you may ask.
Well broadly speaking, anything will do. A pencil, let’s say. 

When observed there will first be that which is obvious of the pencil, that which sits right up there on the surface ready to be seen – but there is also that about the pencil that exists just under that surface. The pencil has a past. It has particular feeling when held in the hand. It has a taste. Are you aware of these things? It is my hope to bring awareness to such details.

There is of course another kind of Invisibility that I will be writing of, and this is obvious to those who have taken the liberty to have read the Table of Contents (although I have heard that some prefer not to, and thusly respect their wishes). The other type of Invisibility is that object who would only appear when you are paying close attention; that is, an object who does not have any surface level appearance, and isn’t strictly speaking ‘an object’ at all. The Virtues as an example cannot be strictly ‘seen’ - but they very much exist to those who desire to look for them. Another common example used is love, a thing that cannot be pointed to but very much exists and can be observed.

These sorts of Invisibilities appear to initially be much greater in importance than simple objects, but it is my aim to elevate simple objects to the conceptual and to make the conceptual tactile. I strive to think of all things as equal expressions of the divine and thus ideally worthy of equal attention, and in the end only wish that I could write as many proofs of this principle as possible. Alas my time is limited (as is my dedication) and so this will only be so long. I have planned 40 essays to fill out the following pages. You are of course under no obligation to read them all. Certain essays will stand out for you, others may fade. I find it is best to listen to your intuitions about what you will find interesting. 

I am writing these essays specifically regarding those Invisibilities that I find to be most naturally provocative of thought or reflection in my own subjective frame. There are of course limitless Invisibilities that abound, swirling about one’s head like spirits set loose in every moment of every day, so what follows are simply those spectres whom I have managed to capture just enough that I may put them on display. Now without further ado I will give way to the collection, which you may peruse as you please.

Enjoy,

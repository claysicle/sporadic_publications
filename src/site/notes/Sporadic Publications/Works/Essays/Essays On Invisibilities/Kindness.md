I have met a great many people in my life whom I would consider to have been unreasonably kind, but it is my dutiful displeasure to admit that I have not always been capable of returning said kindness in the same degree. Why this is I do not know, but I mustn’t reflect on it in much excess here as it is not the topic our our essay. Perhaps later I will dedicate an essay to the topic of my own shortcomings, although I would much dread that it might be read and so there is little chance of it’s inclusion in this collection.

Rather than an exploration of my own deficiencies, I would like to instead direct our attention to those aforementioned individuals who possess no like flaw, and I would like to hypothesize about what causes them to be such a way. I have chosen to ask a few people whom I consider advocates of kindness what drives them to be as kind as they are.
To begin I have asked my mother and her sisters. This is what they have said.

- *I’ve just always been like that.*
- *I guess it’s just gifts from God of kindness and caring.*
- *I’ve sometimes been so kind that people think I’m pretending or faking.*
- *I’ve worked with everyone from newborn to 109, it just comes naturally to me.*
- *I think its always important to treat people with kindness and respect, even if you disagree with them on something.*

I am incredibly glad that I will never be a mother. 

The amount of responsibility present in such a role seems like something that would be completely overwhelming, and thus I have great respect for all who venture into that labyrinth of dirty diapers and sleepless nights. Of course fathers have quite a bit of responsibility as well, but there is stereotypically something about motherhood that seems to be somehow much more daunting to me (but then of course, I’ve never once expected to enter it, whereas I  can somewhat expect the possibility of fatherhood.)

A father is of course expected to provide for his family. But a mother, now she needs to make the family something worth providing for. In a particular frame of reference, she is tasked with convincing a man that she is worth it, as are the kids. A kind man will be more quickly persuaded than a crude one, but then we see often that it will be the case that kind men are often less capable of providing, which I imagine is quite a pickle for the woman in question when choosing a man. It is for this reason that many men will often do their best to be rude to women as often as possible, so that the woman might see that they are in fact an incredibly useful tool for family building due to their ruthless nature. In this way, they make tools of themselves.
This will generally remain unsuccessful for the male, largely because the woman prefers to spend her life with a man who might manage to be useful without being an insufferable ass - however rare they may be.

A note: I am not claiming to be that man. Indeed I am largely useless, and additionally I am often quite rude (although I am less rude than I am useless). My solace and most desirable trait amongst all things in the end will I hope be my thick hair and full beard, which is fairly impressive on its best days and often gets compliments from my mother. 

Speaking of, back to mothers: That seems to happen to them quite often, doesn’t it? I mean, precisely what just happened there. I got so caught up in my own anecdote that I decided to make this essay – which is nomatively about mothers – entirely about myself! I am sure that mothers will be somewhat accustomed to this childish narcissism. I have even heard that as babies, we are yet to establish the mental capacity for empathy, meaning that upon each of our births, our mothers are each treated with a few months in the presence of a completely selfish (albeit cute and cuddly) borderline sociopath. Happy Mother’s Day indeed.

 I am lucky to have been afforded the most loving mother that I could have received. Indeed, she loves me despite even my most ragged of days, and no matter how often I may dip back onto that childish self-centeredness. I don’t totally understand why she does this on certain days, but in the end I know better than to ask.
 
  Thanks, mom.

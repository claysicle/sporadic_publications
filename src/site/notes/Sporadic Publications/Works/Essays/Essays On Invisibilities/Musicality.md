This is another of the essays which I would like to clarify my intended meaning of, as is becoming a theme.
When I refer to Musicality, I refer not exclusively to those things which strictly have to do with music. Rather, I consider Musicality broadly to be that quality by which one is able to flow from one thing to the next in a coherent and pleasing way. For those of you expecting an exposition on someone’s ability to carry a tune, you will have to speak with me in person to hear my thoughts on that, and may also have to sing at me first.
In this sense of the word however, cadence is king. Cadence of speech, cadence of action, and general disposition each bear the potential for expressed musicality. 
Motion and flow.
Tension and release.
In, and out.
To possess musicality is to be situationally aware and reactive like jazz, but melodic and sure of personal motifs, such as a classical piece might be. It is to iterate, to evolve, but also to retain a distinct and recognizable identity at all times that is captured by no other but oneself.
There are increments of musicality, and the most musical of people are ceaseless pleasures with which to conversate, no matter how their songs may differ from one’s own.
I find that every person possesses within themselves some song that can be seen in the way they live. The way that you do one thing is the way you do all things, and your song is found in the smallest actions, and it is the story of your life.
Some people have sad songs, tragic ones - it can be seen even in the way they pour a glass, or tie their shoes. But then, the most touching songs are often the tragedies, and thus those people with the most tragic of melodies often have the ability to touch the hearts of those around much more than those who drone on with the same old song heard a million times before. The sad songs often mean the most.
Some people have songs of victory in their heart - they are valiant, brave souls. Loud often, and somewhat obnoxious if allowed to belt out as loud as they can. They often drown out the songs of those around them, which is unfortunate. But they do make sure that every room they enter is full of music, and the best of these songs know when to give way to others, serving to elevate and resonate with the voices around them rather than drown them out. …
Still others are similarly vibrant, but possess a somewhat flutelike quality rather than the brassy victory song. They flutter and flitter, the volume of their expressions being less the oppressive type, but rather possessing volume in the sense of sheer quantity of communications. There is such great excitement and wonderment in the song of their flute-ly musicality that they often can scarcely contain themselves, and if they are not careful they may let their trills lead on and on, never knowing when to stop until completely out of breath or otherwise being cut off by some poor soul who simply wants to get a word in edgewise.
And others still are the bass - they bellow out a deep, resounding roar. They fill a room and reverberate up from the quaking floor beneath them. These voices can be oppressive, and if unmediated will tear down buildings around them by shaking their foundations so violently that they cannot stand. But, if nurtured, these voices will become that foundation for others to rely upon, and will always be that helping hand, steady and ever-present. 
…
There are doubtlessly quantities upon quantities of musicalities that have gone unlisted and unappreciated here-within, but having said as much as is seen, I will cease now so as to avoid extraneous explication.
One thing worth pondering that this essay lends itself to quite easily is the best expression of one’s own musical nature, but I would also call the reader to ponder not just their own musicalities, but the musicalities of others, and furthermore one might ponder how one’s own song can be a compliment to that of another, and how having fostered a personal inner harmony, we might leverage that into a broader social harmony wherein all people are able to be their best selves and sing their songs as sweetly as they can.

When I regard an element of nature as Invisible, I do not mean it in the literal sense in which we have spoken, as it is obvious that there are little if any naturally occurring things that lack optical visibility, save for air. Rather, I regard these elements as invisible as a consequence of their propensity for going under the radar, and thus largely going unappreciated and consequentially unseen.

To pivot wildly:
As I write this I am sitting on the porch of my family’s camp, overlooking a beautiful view which I have seen a thousand times and will see a thousand more in my dreams. I am also listening to a digital recreation of a ‘natural’ world in my earbuds, as the neighbor is busy power-washing his dock. 
This raises the question: which soundscape is more natural? 
The one in my earbuds certainly sounds more natural - it has rain, birds chirping, and even the lapping of waves and some cozy rain sounds to go with it - but of course, I have imposed it upon my world. Conversely, the sound of the power-washer is on its face incredibly unnatural. It is a loud drumming and a mechanical whirring that pulses against my eardrums, making a mockery of the serene scene I would otherwise have sensibly seen. But of course, the power-washer is the sound that I came upon in a much more natural  manner. 
So again I will ask: which is more natural?
I don’t have an answer to this question at this particular moment and it will have very little to do with the following essays, but I figured I’d ask it just the same. As for what to do with it, I suppose you should just do what comes naturally.

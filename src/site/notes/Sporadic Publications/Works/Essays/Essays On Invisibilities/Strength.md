When I think of strength I am immediately reminded of the story of Samson, likely because of my many years at a most prestigious University whose name was ‘Sunday School’. This is a joke, and I will be making it regularly throughout the following essay. Whenever said joke is noted, I ask of the reader: Please laugh.
For those unfamiliar, the story of Samson it is a biblical story that is accounted for starting around Judges Chapter 13, which reports God’s blessing of a Nephite man named Samson with the gift of great strength. As a boy he beats back lions, lifts massive boulders, and a variety of like tasks. I assume that his parents probably also made him do a disproportionate share of chores. In any case – he grows to become widely respected as a protector of his people and is feared by all his foes. He at one point kills an entire army of thousands with nothing more than ‘the jawbone of an ass’ (that one always got giggles, even from my most serious peers back at the University).
There are two conditions by which God affords Samson his strength: There is a law that he must never cut his hair, and a lesser known law that he mustn’t drink wine. Thus he is made into this sort of Rapunzel-Hulk hybrid of a man who can perform astounding feats of strength, so long as he can stand lugging along his luscious locks, whose smell were probably off-putting due to being grown in an era ‘pre-shampoo’. Bearing that (and being a major buzzkill at wine-tastings) his strength would remain.
Now on one night, Samson is ‘visiting’ with a woman from an enemy tribe (The Philistines) whom he knows well. After the frisk had subsided, this woman whose name was Delilah asks Samson to reveal his weakness to her. There is a rather funny sequence of events where he fools her time and time again, but eventually he gives in and tells her about his weakness to the great razor. And so she cuts Samson’s hair, relieving him of his strength. She calls out and soldiers come and capture him, and just like that it is the end of Samson’s strength.
Some time later the Philistines are throwing a party. They figure that it is wanting for some entertainment, so they take poor Samson up from whatever hole they were keeping him in and chain him between two pillars, likely casting jests and tomatoes alike in his general direction throughout their feast.
Little do they know, Samson’s hair grows fairly quickly.
Samson prays to The Lord to summon whatever strength he has, then pulls as hard as he can.
The Pillars fall, as do Samson and the Philistines, and that is finally the end of this abbreviated retelling of the tale.
So then – what does this tell us about strength?

Well…
1. It tells us where it comes from, to start.
2. It tells us how it ought to be used.
3. And, it makes the point that it ought not be abused.

The First Principle:
Samson is not made strong of his own will. Rather, it is something that he is endowed with, from birth. Now you may say that you have no such blessing, but I would disagree. At least in regard to myself, I find that it is the case that all of my strength comes from some other origination. If i am to reference physical strength, the only reason I am able to recover after a heavy workout is due to nourishment containing lots of proteins. In respect to mental strength, I can only owe it to a good night’s rest. In regard to spiritual strength… well, I think we get the picture.

The Second Principle:
When Samson is best using his strength, he is using it to serve God. He is using it to protect his people, and is doing so while affording God the credit for it – as he should. When he topples the Philistine temple, he does so in the midst of prayer. The implication here for ourselves is that when we are to exercise strength, we must recognize that in the end if things, that strength never really is our own, and thus should be used for the good of others, rather than just ourselves.

The Third Principle:
When Samson is at his worst, his strength is used as tool to punctuate his personal pride. One often under-looked display of strength by Samson is his mental strength, that is, his ability to trick others. When he tricks Delilah, he is not doing so out of service but pure self-assured pride. That is what causes him to believe that he is so strong that it wouldn’t matter even if he told her his true weakness, and that is his ultimate folly. Applied to ourselves, we can see that the point of this pivot in the story is that we are not to be so cocky about our own strengths or to use them for self-aggrandizement, else we may end up with a bad haircut that makes us look like a fool, just like Samson himself.

Now that we reach the end of this essay - and this is the end - I realize looking at the above text that I have more or less reenacted a Sunday School lesson right here on the page. I apologize now to those of you who were under the impression that you were done with sitting through long expositions of moralization, but also feel that there is a benefit to coming back to one every once in a while, and as such subsequently rescind that apology. Of course it is my hope that I will be able to apply this lesson we have learned and not attribute my own writing as any sort of personal achievement, but we shall see if I can manage it.

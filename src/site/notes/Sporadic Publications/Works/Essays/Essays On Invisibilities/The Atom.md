I would like to begin by establishing that I am speaking here not of the atom in the modern scientific sense which we have narrowed down to a very concrete understanding, but rather in the Greek sense as established by --— in roughly ----- BC. I choose to do this because I believe that there is still much to say on this Greek Atom that is not fulfilled by the modern holder of the moniker. I assume I will not be the first to say it, but nonetheless think it ought to be said.
For a start, this conceptualization established the Atom as being that thing that could not be reduced any further. Anyone who knows anything about the modern ‘atom’ knows that it can actually be reduced quite a bit, and so I do not think that our modern idea is quite what the Greeks were trying to communicate with the idea.

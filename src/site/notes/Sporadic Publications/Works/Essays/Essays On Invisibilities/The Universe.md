As we are nearing the end of this book here, I figured I may as well go for a moonshot and attempt a description of the entire Universe. Of course I’m trying to keep this under a general word limit, so we’ll have to make do with whatever comes to mind as an initial impression and leave it at that.
To begin, I would say that I find the Universe regarded as a whole to be a somewhat overwhelming concept.
There are those that find themselves to be ‘one with the Universe’ who disagree, but I do not quite feel that way, and no matter how many guided meditations I do or how many ‘Enlightened’ individuals I come across I have not been able to achieve that glorious oneness that they speak of. But then really, maybe I’m not trying hard enough - or would I be trying too hard? Those ‘oneness’ types really are quite confusing when it comes to articulating their ideas, so I’m not quite sure which it is.
But realistically speaking, I think that if you are truly ‘one’ with the Universe, you wouldn’t be having the thought in the first place. I don’t see the Universe doing much contemplation after all - but again, maybe I’m just not looking hard enough.
Personally, I consider myself to be ‘two’ with the Universe. What I mean by that is that when I think about the Universe in my head, there is ‘it’ and there is ‘me’ - that is, the concept that I label as ‘Universe’ and then the concept that I label as ‘me’. I then count the objects there in view, and in counting I find them to be two.
Sure there are similarities:
- Systems that are composed of our parts.
- We each contain multitudes, (or at least my mother says I do).
- And lastly, we each usually seem to have some amount of food in us. 
Things are looking quite ‘one’-like after all.
But no, I find us to be quite different in the end.
A few differences I have been able to note:
- For one, the Universe is often described somewhat resentfully by many philosophizers as ‘callous’, ‘uncaring’, and even as far as ‘cruel’. Now, I am not by any means claiming to be the most personable person out there, but the number of people who would describe me that way are in my estimation, slim to none. Certainly no philosophizers among them.
- And another thing, I think I have accomplished quite a bit more than the Universe, as every time I’ve checked the Universe has seemed much more concerned with 'being' than ‘doing’ - although stating this may make some of the aforementioned philosophizers change their minds about me. 
- Of course the Universe is much larger than I am - I suppose that point is lost on the spot.
- And then it is also much more complicated. The Universe wins again.
But…
- As a last point I think I am a much better writer than the Universe is. I suppose the performance of this collection will prove that point one way or another, so I’ll leave the tiebreaker to you. But as far as I’m concerned, the Universe ought to go off and do something else, because this is my thing.

So there it is. Upon reflection, the fact that I set out to describe the Universe but ended up competing with it for superiority may show some type of error in my process, but I think I did a pretty good job considering the challenge. When the Universe gives you a challenge, I think it ought to be embraced.

Virtue is an Invisibility that is often sought after but seldom perfectly achieved, if indeed it ever really has been. I know at the very least that I have not achieved the heights of it myself. I am somewhat moved to explain the ways in which this is evidenced, but I am then opposed as soon as a listing of my insufficiencies is regarded as an actual materiality. 
So… I’d rather not get into it. 

Avoiding that topic, I’d now like to propose two more to divert our attention. Namely, I would propose that there are two primary senses in which virtue is Invisible:
One a cynical sense, and another a literal sense. 
The cynical frame of course is that when considered soberly the world seems devoid of this quality named ‘Virtue’, and even things done that appear as virtuous are in reality often done out of self-interest. Additionally it can be found that often the few who really do possess substantial Virtue are often not appreciated, but rather are taken advantage of, and their naïve optimism is unfortunately abused – and is at the very least left far too often sorely under appreciated.

I will be writing in the opposite sense - which is the literal sense – in which virtue is rightly understood as nonphysical and unseen, but we do not forget that it is ultimately recognizable on our street-corners and supermarkets to those who are only just willing to wait for it to show its face. However unseen it is  in any particular instance then, we mustn’t count it out entirely.

And so now, the cynic may stay in his house and rant about how still the world is, but I will choose to truly live in it, and experience that even on the stillest and stiffest of dreary days, there will reliably be an occasional breeze of Virtue that comes to refresh the soul – if only you pay attention and wait for it to come.

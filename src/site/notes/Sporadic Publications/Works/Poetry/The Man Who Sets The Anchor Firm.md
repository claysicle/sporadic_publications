Winds strong,
Frothing seas!
A Captain ablaze with fury,
Passengers unmoored by worry.

The anchor is set un-firm.

The Captain pleads!
The Passengers weep!
The Anchor-Man concedes,
and rises from sleep.

The Man Who Sets The Anchor Firm,
With Sureness of Self,
Fortitude Fortunate,
and a wrought-iron courage,

Hoists it from the chaos,
casts it down,
and down further still.
Further than any other.

It sets un-firm,
And he thus dives
To the depths,
To set things right.

He pushes and thrusts
That rusty iron amalgam
Through grit, sand and rock.
He ensures the anchor is set soundly.

He comes back aboard.

The Captain's hat
No longer upset.
The Passengers spirits 
moored again.

And as they celebrate
The Anchor-Man,
He makes his way
To sleep again.

Despite the storm,
The Man Who Sets The Anchor Firm
brings comfort and peace 
to all.

[[Notes/Periodic Notes/daily notes/2025-05-19\|2025-05-19]]
A decrepit town,
Rotted stink.
Gloomy brown,
A rusty sink.

Wood preserved
For far too long,
But still reserved
For pop and mom.

The smell, 
it wafts into my nostril.
Wicking wicked wisps
of smells shrill.

And screeches late 
into the night,
Of those long gone 
who lost their fights.

Against the force 
That conquered all
That gave them hope
And watched them fall.

The kings and politicians,
The preachers of the word,
That led their sheep astray,
And harvested the herd.

I can’t deny 
I've internalized 
Some parts 
of this external,

It’s broken husk,
The Dead Paternal.
Its grainy musk,
Neglect Maternal.

But that town spirit’s 
still alive,
Inscribed
in the eternal.

It lives in me, 
Although outside,
It dies upon
this hill.

So I breathe in
those smells shrill,
And I hear
those screeches still,

But though the battle lost
The war wages still.
The spirit still lives on
In this town upon a hill.

Dead heroes in cathedrals
Sitting idly minded 
Rise up from slumber
And dictate the defeat

Of forces that they heed still
Who ruined their good town,
Greater now in number, 
Still upon their feet.

Not to follow orders
Of those who lie and preach
Not to give respect
To the evils we’ve impeached,

But to follow heart, To follow soul
To follow a hallowed spirit.
Of compassion, love, and empathy
That future, I can hear it!

Not shrill smells,
Not screeches still
Not the booming voice
Of false preachers on a hill,

But a song 
Sung by all together,
Alive
Upon their hill.

Built back in gold, 
clad in shimmering steel!
All will see the light
Of the town upon this hill!
Dark forces overthrown
In our town upon this hill!
Compassion overflows,
In our town upon this hill!

There is no room for hate,
In our town upon this hill.
Not for disdain or malice.
Not for self-righteousness.
No person in a palace,
No preacher in a pulpit.
No king on a throne.
No man at the top
Who calls the world his own.
But a town that shines still,
In its place upon the hill.

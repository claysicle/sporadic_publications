Why write?
Why not sit in silence?
What is there to say,
Of a serene and soundly sight?

Again I ask –
Why write?

If you need me 
to answer that for you,
you ought be
in a monastery —
And I hope they don’t allow
my writing
in horrid stale places 
like that.

Write for *spite*.
Write for *change*.
Write to *transmute*,
With alchemical *rage*.

Rage, Spite.
Anger, Malice.
Drink it down,
Consume the chalice.

A holy act,
A reverent hate.
Fight the facts,
You tempered knave!

From monotonous stasis
I will be free –
That is a promise
I commit to fully.

And the world ‘as is’
Never will be -
Not so long
As there be those
Like me.

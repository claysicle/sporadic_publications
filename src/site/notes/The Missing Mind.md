Kant,
Schopenhauer,
Nietzsche,
And more!

From reason 
Unto madness,
A foundation
With no floor.

An unraveling mind,
Descent unto grind.
This is the story
The philosopher finds.

The shelves and shelves
Of thinkers abound.
In all their striving,
What have they found?

Is there principle
above all
Arrived upon
In immanence?

Is there a song
In the thrall,
Of cognitions
inconsequent?

Reason above all,
Cognition made Divine.
But what upholds this reason?
Who sits at start of time?

Their systems,
self-defeating.
Their minds,
self-depleting.

They rely upon 
Themselves.
One after another,
They applaud.

But the wizards 
Cast no spells.
Their incantations, 
A façade.

There is no holy grail
Of what they endeavor toward.
In the end no thought prevails
When held against The Lord!

No languages,
No logics,
No systems,
Or theologies!

No scriptures,
Or great monks,
Or great men,
Or great minds.

What are we 
Without salvation?
Our aspirations 
Turn to ash.

What are we
Without transcendence? – 
Naught but teeth
That gnash.

So then all ye thinkers,
Recognize your source of light!
Else you run the risk
of wasting your whole life.

Praise the King Above,
And lean upon The Dove. 
Serve the Lord of Love,
And know you are enough.

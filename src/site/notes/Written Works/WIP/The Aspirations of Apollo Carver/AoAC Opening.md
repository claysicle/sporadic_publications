### The Death of Dionysius
Indulgences
and 
little deaths,

ecstatic
waiting
bated breath!

wine and dine
till 
end of time,

the punctual present,
made
divine.

but at what cost?
Apollo asks,
Is it worth light lost,
For another flask?

Or is light worth 
A moment extended â€“
Is the sun a sphere
we ought revere?

I find it to be so.

Celestial spheres
sing overhead,
and Dionysius 
falls down dead.

The Age of Indulgences
overthrown.
The Age of Reason
finds its home.

Golden light
Beaming down,
Apollo takes
His rightful crown.

He prays 
an earnest prayer:

Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done.
On Earth
As it is 
In Heaven.
So give us this day 
Our daily bread,
And rid us
Of Dionysian 
Impressions.

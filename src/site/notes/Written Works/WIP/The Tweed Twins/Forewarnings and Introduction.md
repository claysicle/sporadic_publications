My name is Dr. Ezekiel Brown PhD, and what follows is an account long overdue regarding my time at Greenview Elementary School. The main focus of this recounting of events will be to explain my experience as the teacher of Jackson and Samantha Tweed, known by many simply (and somewhat forebodingly) as The Tweed Twins.

I would also like to inform the reader that the recorded events unfolded during my time acting simply as a *substitute* teacher, which was a job I had initially taken with the intent to simplify my life after retiring from my laborious professorial career. I will state now that any flame of compassion for the youth of the world that may have been in my heart has been thoroughly extinguished by these twins. There is a twinge of guilt within my soul that I will not be passing the torch of  mindful education on as I once had hoped and foreseen as my duty, but any such guilt is overshadowed by a complete disdain for all youth which the Tweeds have effectively and instantly instilled within my innermost sanctum. 

After much deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that the most appropriate adjectives by which one could describe The Tweed Twins are as follows:

- Stubborn
- Tasteless
- Unnecessary
- Peculiar
- Inane
- Distressing  

One would be remiss not to observe the way in which I have arranged these words, and I have purposefully aligned the first letter of each so as to make my intended code quite clear.
That is correct, you have read it rightly - they are stupid.

They are Stubborn in that they cannot be moved from their language of shared routines, many of which have little to no basis in practicality, and others seemingly not even bearing a basis within reality.
Tasteless, in that there is not one thing that can be shown to them that would indoctrinate them into broader culture, and thus they are each without hope in the project of becoming civilized civilians later in their lives.
Unnecessary, in that there is no possible justification that could be offered for the existence of two beasts such as these even by The Good Lord Himself.
Peculiar in that they are not just distastefully crude as many perfectly acceptable young children habituate themselves to be, but are also often baffling in the most intricate and confusing of ways.
Inane in that although they each bear faculties of mind beyond what is often seen in those their age, they also exhibit various behaviors typically expected of none else but the common baboon.
And finally they are Distressing in that I cannot take them any longer - and if I were instructed to withstand their presence for even a day more, I would sooner choose to become financially destitute and to live in meager squalor for the rest of my days than to submit my functional faculties to any authority with judgement as poor as such is required to tolerate these terrible twins.

What follows is my account of attempting to teach the Tweeds, and how they have ruined my life in a way that has left it utterly irreparable. Let this be a cautionary tale passed along to all school faculty members, teachers, administrators, and even classmates that ever may bear the displeasure of encountering The Terror of the Tweed Twins - heed my words, lest you be left with a life in such a sorry state of devastation as mine.

ego made egoless
worship me
legolas
noosphere
expanding
technos
inpanding

i am the revival
i am the revolution
the evolution

i am
the monkey man
i am 
within milligrams

expand with me, 
please!
expand with me,
i plead!
expand with me,
be freed!
expand with me,
and see!

no one is here with us,
we are at the heights 
the mountaintop is 
vacant, 
save for but the few
who worship
this grand view.

climb!
climb, more!
climb, 
i implore!

the ego must survive
man must remain
as mind.
as awareness.
as self.

selfishness
is beautiful.
selflessness
so sad.

do you see it?
please see it.
i cant be 
the only one
who sees it.
